# Bad Architecture

*Where does bad architecture come from, what is it's impact and how do we stop it.*

April 2022 - Guy Wicks

## Where does bad architecture come from?

- Why do we need architecture?
- Where does bad architecture come from?
- How can we measure architectural quality?

*"If you think good architecture is expensive, try bad architecture"*

Brian Foote

---
## 

- What does *bad* architecture look like?
- What *causes* bad architecture?
- What is the *cost* of bad architecture?

---
## So why do we keep doing bad architecture?

**The *Homomorphic* organization**

A structure-preserving relationship between two sets of things is called a *homomorphism*

*"Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations."*

*"When all you have is box of hammers, every problem looks like a nail."*

---
## So why do we keep doing bad architecture?
**The *Sunk Cost* fallacy** 

Continuing a course of action where the time, effort, or money invested may not now outweigh the final benefits.

*"Because the design which occurs first is almost never the best possible, the prevailing system concept may need to change. Therefore, flexibility of organization is important to effective design."*

---
## So why do we keep doing bad architecture?
**The *Nirvana* fallacy**

Solutions to problems are rejected because they are not perfect.

*"It is an article of faith among experienced system designers that given any system design, someone someday will find a better one to do the same job. It is misleading and incorrect to speak of the design for a specific job, unless this is understood in the context of space, time, knowledge, and technology."*

---
## So why do we keep doing bad architecture?
**The *Argument to moderation* fallacy**

Assuming that a compromise between two positions is always correct.

*"Ways must be found to reward design managers for keeping their organizations lean and flexible."*

---
## So why do we keep doing bad architecture?

**The *Quantitative* fallacy**

Making an argument using only quantitative observations (measurements, statistical or numerical values) and discounting subjective information that focuses on quality (traits, features, or relationships).

---
## So why do we keep doing bad architecture?
**The *Continuum fallacy* fallacy**

Improperly rejecting a claim for being imprecise.

*"Ways must be found to reward design managers for keeping their organizations lean and flexible."*

---
## What is the *cost* of bad architecture?

Cost is not just money...

- Loss of agility
- Loss of re-usability
- Loss of opportunity
- Loss of potential
- Loss of professional value for Architecture

----
## Playing the long game

*"Nobody cares about quality until after it ships"* - apocryphal

Decisions made in design can persist for decades.

An inch in the right direction is better than a mile in the wrong one. 

Never time to do it right. Always time to do it again.

---
## When quality counts

*When quality is the goal, then compromise is a failure.*

- Decision making based on evidence
- *"Perfect is the enemy of good"*
- Breaking the YNGNI/MVP argument
- You've got to *Build Architecture*

---
## Who's in charge?



---
## What's the change?


---
## What good looks like


---
## Conclusion

2 + 2 = 5?

---
## Conclusion

2 + 2 = 5

*for large values of 2*

**If you're not satisfied with your outputs, then look at your inputs.**
